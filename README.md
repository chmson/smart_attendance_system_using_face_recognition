# smart_attendance_system_using_face_recognition

A 92% accuracy rate in facial recognition has been attained by the Smart Attendance System with the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Both an Excel sheet and a CSV file contain the student attendance data.

The algorithm used in the system which is SVM has given better performance than DT(Decision Tree) algorithm and NB(Naïve Bayes) algorithm. The Decision Tree Algorithm achieved an accuracy of 62% and Naïve Bayes Algorithm has achieved an accuracy of 88%.
